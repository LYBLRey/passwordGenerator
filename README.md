A sub-par password generator, definitely needs some more tweaks for it to be able to generate a nice strong password!

## Description

This password generator will ask you to first type in a number from 8-128 to determine the generated password's LENGTH. Then will proceed to ask if you wish for numbers, lower cases, upper cases, and special characters. Once the prompt takes in your specified criteria, it will generate a random password accordingly!

My motivation for this project was to figure out if I was able to make an eventListener and a button do a specific (mildly complicated) action (which is generating a RANDOM password) other than just knowing how to use a button for links or even simpler page actions.

I built this project so then I will be able to test my javascript skills thus far to see whether or not I would be able to use Math.random correctly for my page/button to generate random characters!

The problem that this project solves is when an individual may need a random password for who knows what, this page will easily and quickly produce one for them with just a few clicks!

I learned how to use a button more in depth, practice coding in javascript, mess with functions, make a prompt, and generate some characters with simple button clicks on a page!

## Usage

This website will allow you to click the red Generate Password button, ask you a series of prompts for a specified criteria to your liking, then produce a "secured" random generated password for you to copy and paste at ease!

## Known Bugs

Code seems to print out numbers 0-3 the most and print out numbers first before printing out lower cases, upper cases, and special characters!

## Features

Click the red Generate Button on the page will pop up a window which will ask prompts, then user will click "Yes" or "No" to create a specified criteria for their about-to-be randomly generated password!
